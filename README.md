## Introduction
<p align="justify">MemoRide is a web-based application designed to facilitate users in booking cultural tourist destinations. Through its homepage, users can easily select and search for cultural tourist destinations in Indonesia based on their preferences. Once users have chosen a destination, they can view ratings given by other users. The application also provides features for users to track their booking history and travel history, allowing them to keep a record of their previous trips.</p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, the application also includes users with admin roles, who have the ability to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the available tourist destinations. With this feature, admins can easily manage information and details of the tourist destinations and the users.</p>
